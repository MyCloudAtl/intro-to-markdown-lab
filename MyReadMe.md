# Spanish Flan

| **Total Time**: 4 hrs 15 mins |
| **Prep Time**: 15 mins |
| **Cook Time**: 1 hr |
| **Additional Time**: 3 hrs |
| **Servings**: 8 |
| **Yield**: 1 (9-inch) flan |

## Ingredients
>1 cup white sugar

>3 large eggs

>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk

>1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to `350 degrees F (175 degrees C)`.

2. Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. ***Carefully*** *pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.*

3. Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. ***Carefully*** *pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.*

4. Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. Remove from the oven and ***carefully*** *transfer baking dish to a wire rack;* cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days.

5. To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; ***carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan.***
